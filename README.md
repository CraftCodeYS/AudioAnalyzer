# AudioAnalyzer
The AudioAnalyzer visualize the frequency response into percussive- and harmonic-groups
The external library [Librosa](https://librosa.org/ "Librosa.org") was used to implement the code.

- To play your own wav file with the AudioAnalyzer,\ 
simply put the file into the folder "music" and rename it to "music.wav".

- In addition, the frequency groups can be displayed as a PyPlot by undoing 
the comment in the area between `### SHOW PERCUSSIVE AND HARMONICS PER PYPLOT #### ADITIONAL`.
